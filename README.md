# FerrisPlay
An AirPlay 1 implementation in Rust.
## Goals
With this project I want to breakfree from the platform limitations imposed on the awesome AirPlay protocol.
**PRs welcome!**
## Motivation
I'm currently in high school in germany and soon we'll all be getting iPads, to which I'm not looking forward to. So I decided to take matters into my own hands and implement AirPlay 1.
## Platform support
For now the only Platform I intend to support is Linux(X11/Wayland). If you want to support Windows, then goahead and make a PR, but I probably want sink too much of my time into this.
This is due to the lack of devices to test on and a lack of motivation on my side. Windows has got way too many exclusive programs, that we(the Linux community) have to run through Wine. So why shouldn't we have something exclusive?
## Notes
The reverse engineering, of AirPlay 1, wasn't done by me and I don't want to take any credit for it. [Original source](https://nto.github.io/AirPlay.html)
